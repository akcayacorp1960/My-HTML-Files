        <h2>About Sound recording and reproduction</h2>
        <!--Sound recording and reproduction -->
        <p><q>Sound recording and reproduction<br> is an <strong>electrical, mechanical, electronic,
        or digital inscription and re-creation of sound waves, such as spoken voice, singing,
        instrumental music, or sound effects.</strong> The two main classes of sound recording technology
        are analog recording and digital recording. <em>(Wikipedia)</em></q></p>

        <h2>About Digital audio workstation (DAW)</h2>
        <!--Digital audio workstation (DAW) -->
        <p><q>A digital audio workstation (DAW)<br> is an <strong>electronic device or
        application software used for recording, editing and producing audio files.</strong>
        DAWs come in a wide variety of configurations from a single software program on a
        laptop, to an integrated stand-alone unit, all the way to a highly complex configuration of
        numerous components controlled by a central computer. Regardless of configuration, modern
        DAWs have a central interface that allows the user to alter and mix multiple recordings
        and tracks into a final produced piece. <em>(Wikipedia)</em></q></p>

        <h2>About Equalizer</h2>
        <!--Equalizer -->
        <p><q>Equalization<br> is the <strong>process of adjusting the balance between
        frequency components within an electronic signal.</strong>
        The most well known use of equalization is
        in sound recording and reproduction
        but they're are many other applications in electronics and telecommunications.
        The circuit or equipment used to achieve equalization is called an equalizer.
        These devices strengthen or weaken the energy of specific frequency bands or "frequency ranges".
